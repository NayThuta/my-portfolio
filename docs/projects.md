## Featured Projects

### [üíß Sustainable Irrigation System](projects/sustainable-irrigation-system.md)

**‚öôÔ∏è Hardware Engineering & Embedded Systems**  
Designed a microcontroller-based smart irrigation system to optimize water usage for third-world farmers facing monsoon rains and summer droughts. I led the hardware layout, PCB design, and circuit optimization, delivering a cost-effective, scalable prototype.

**Key Achievements:**

- Developed a functional prototype using the PIC18F4550 microcontroller, integrating rain and water level sensors for real-time environmental feedback.
- Optimized PCB layout with minimal jumper wires, enhancing durability and affordability for small-scale farmers in regions like Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.
- Enabled automated pump control and precision irrigation via PWM, reducing water waste and manual intervention.

### [üå± Wormbrews: Sustainable Fertilizer Startup](projects/wormbrews.md)

**üí° Entrepreneurship & Environmental Innovation**  
Co-developed a multi-tiered vermicomposting kit to convert urban food waste into organic fertilizer in Singapore. I led market research, customer interviews, market validation, and competitor analysis to shape the project‚Äôs strategy.

**Key Achievements:**

- Identified strong market interest (85.7% from surveys) among urban households and schools, validating demand for space-efficient composting.
- Conducted interviews revealing user priorities like odor control, leading to design refinements and educational content.
- Analyzed competitors (e.g., WERMS. INC, Worm Factory), positioning WormBrews as an affordable, compact solution with recycled PET connectors.

### [üíä Patient Sentiment Analysis for Pharma](projects/patient-sentiment-analysis.md)

**üß† Machine Learning & Data Analytics**  

Built a machine learning system to classify patient sentiments from 27,703 drug reviews as positive, neutral, or negative. I spearheaded data preparation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and designed an interactive Power BI dashboard for stakeholder insights.

**Key Achievements:**

- Cleaned and analyzed a large dataset from [drugs.com](https://www.drugs.com), ensuring data integrity for robust sentiment analysis.
- Applied K-means clustering and reviewed XGBoost model development, enhancing predictive accuracy for sentiment classification.
- Created a Power BI dashboard using the predicted dataset (`predicted_sentiments.csv`), visualizing trends for customer feedback and product improvement.
