## **Overview**
WormBrews began as a vision by Group 3 (Leong Kai Wen, Nay Thuta, Samuel Toh Zheng Hao, Shamus Lim Kah Hwee) to create a multi-tiered vermicomposting kit addressing Singapore's need for space-efficient, eco-friendly composting. My primary contributions include [market research](#market-research), [customer interviews](#customer-interviews), [market validation](#market-validation), and [competitor analysis](#competitor-analysis), all of which drove the project's early development. Launched with enthusiasm, the project aimed to turn urban food waste into sustainable fertilizer.

## **Market Research**
- **Target Audience**: Identified urban households, gardeners, and schools in Singapore, motivated by limited space and growing eco-consciousness.
- **Survey Insights**: Surveys showed 85.7% interest, with respondents valuing space savings and odorless operation.
- **Consumer Needs**: Revealed a demand for affordable, low-maintenance composting alternatives, shaping our initial strategy.

---

## **Customer Interviews**
- **Methodology**: I conducted in-person interviews to assess the kit's feasibility and desirability, asking, "What did they think of using a multi-tiered vermicomposting kit to reduce food waste and produce fertilizer?"
- **Key Findings**: 
    1. 22.2% prioritized space efficiency and odor control, with positive notes on indoor usability.
    2. Some saw it as a "portable idea" for domestic use but not industrial scale, with confusion over functionality.
    3. One respondent felt it was "a waste" for small families due to minimal food waste, questioning its practicality.
- **Action Taken**: Feedback prompted design refinements and educational content, though challenges persisted.

---

## **Market Validation**
- **Survey Results**: The 85.7% interest rate initially confirmed demand among urban Singaporeans.
- **Interview Outcomes**: Supported niche appeal but highlighted scalability and understanding gaps.
- **Feasibility**: Real-world input aligned with Singapore's space constraints, yet raised doubts about widespread adoption.

- **Key Competitors**: 
    1. **WERMS. INC**: Higher-cost vermicomposting solutions.
    2. **Worm Factory**: Multi-tiered systems, less affordable and urban-tailored.
- **WormBrews Advantage**: Offered lower costs with recycled PET connectors, a compact design, and odorless operation.
- **Market Positioning**: Aimed to be an affordable alternative, with a unique selling point of educational workshops targeted towards hobbyists, schools, and other potential customers to enhance understanding and adoption, though desirability and scalability issues persisted.

## **Project Conclusion**
Despite early promise, the interview findings, combined with scalability issues and insufficient waste volume for small households, led us to scrap WormBrews. This decision reflects a commitment to aligning with user needs and market realities. The experience honed my skills in market research and validation, offering valuable lessons for future projects.
